# Overview


The purpose of this activity that I have given myself is to help broaden the amount of programming languages that I am familiar with.

The software that I have written in this is meant to be a demonstration of how to perform basic tasks using the Kotlin programming language.

# Development Environment

In order to complete this software I used Visual Studio Code with a few extensions, being Kotlin Language and Code Runner.

# Useful Websites

These are a few of the websites that I visited to help in writing this software.

- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/)
- [In Kotlin](https://in-kotlin.com/)

# Future Work

Potential improvements

- I wanted to go more into using functions but I kept running into errors that I was unable to resolve in my given time frame causing me to remove a lot of what I had worked on

- I could probably go more in depth with the different kinds of number variables

- commenting may need some work
